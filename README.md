# AHT Roadmap

My personal Antifragile Healthcare Track (AHT) roadmap.  
Documenting how I'm building practical skills in AI and ML infrastructure with a focus on healthcare systems and applied technology.

---

Current Focus
- Strengthen foundation in AI-collaborative coding
- Begin a certification in cloud and ML infrastructure
- Add early projects to GitHub that demonstrate learning in public

---

Next Checkpoints
1. Finish GitHub setup  
2. Upload first "vibe coding" project  
3. Start a certification (AWS Cloud Practitioner or Google Digital Leader)  
4. Build a simple data pipeline for healthcare data (ETL demo)  
5. Add 1–2 infrastructure-related repositories with clear READMEs

Notes
This roadmap is a living document. It tracks my progress, challenges, and milestones along the AHT journey.
